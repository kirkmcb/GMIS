# GMIS
This README has been created to outline the proposed system design for a new Student Group Management Information System (GMIS), which is a project requirement for the ICT School at the University of Tasmaniaâ€™s KIT506 course.  

This system will provide students with the wherewithal to find out about group meetings outside of class time and to find out when other students in their groups are available for ad hoc project meetings.  This project prototype, which has been modelled using Star UML and coded in Visual Studio, will ultimately incorporate both textual and image information and deliver it through a single Windows application.
